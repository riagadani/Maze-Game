# Maze-Game
Created a maze game in which the player travels through a maze, choosing between a 2D and 3D visualization. The player moves using arrow keys. Additional features include a limited window of visibility with less and less of the maze viewable as the players "flashlight" runs low on batteries that can be picked up throughout the maze.
